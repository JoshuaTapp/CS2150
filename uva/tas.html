My name is Ayushi and I’m a second year CS major in the College. This is my first semester TAing 2150. When I took this course I probably attended OH more than 100 times, so I’m excited to help you all the same way other TA’s helped me! When I’m not in office hours, I’m either participating in WiCS &amp; GWC here on grounds or reading conspiracy theories and visiting new places. Really looking forward to meeting you guys this semester :) <br clear="all"></p>

In my free time, you can often find me playing my violin at Old Cabell, or climbing at Slaughter if I’m feeling athletic.
<p>
<p>Fun fact: I love carrying fruit snacks in my backpack, and usually carry a handful of packs with me. If you ever need a sugar boost, hit me up! Hopefully I’ll still have a few left by the end of the day… <br clear="all"></p>

Hey Guys! I'm a fourth year from Bristow, Virginia, majoring in computer engineering. This is my third semester TAing for 2150, and I hope to keep my record of &quot;&quot;making 0 students cry in office hours&quot;&quot; alive. If you see me around outside of lab / office hours, I'll most likely be in the NI lab at Thornton or the Dell playing basketball. I'm always down to play so if anyone ever needs a shooting partner I'm down!<p>Some fun facts about me: 1) I don't have a single photo of myself on my phone, 2) I can solve a Rubiks cube in &lt; 30 seconds, 3) I love collecting sneakers.

Hey! I'm a 3rd year in the engineering school studying computer science. This is my 2nd semester TA-ing this course. I also teach a web development course at HackCville. When I actually have free time :( I like to draw and paint! Fun fact about me is I'm really, reallyyy good at this board game called Pucket. I'm always up for a good talk about anything, and I'm definitely down for a Pucket match!

Hey Friends! My name is Anna Cuddeback and I'm a second year from Medford, Massachusetts studying computer engineering and physics. Outside of TAing and classes, I do physics research, resident-advise a first year dorm, and an officer in Outdoors at UVa. I'm really into my chacos, and my diet primarily subsets of peanut butter Clif bars and Dunkin Donuts iced coffee. I am also emotionally attached to my Nalgene. If you're not sure where I am, you can probably find me climbing at Slaughter or scooping up deals at the local Goodwill. Like Dwight Schrute, I always keep an extra set of Birkenstocks in the car for special occasions.

Hiyo! I'm a third-year CS Major from McLean, VA. This is my first semester TAing for 2150. I started TAing for the course because of how much I loved this course when I took it and of course because of how much I love Professor Aaron Bloomfield. He is THE MAN and a CS GOD. (Professor Nguyen and Floryan are also amazing!!) Outside of doing CS and living in Thornton Stacks, I'm an active member of VSA (Vietnamese Student Association). I have too many hobbies at the moment: I play lots of volleyball, basketball, and I have recently gotten into climbing at Slaughter. You'll catch me a lot in Mem gym or the AFC because I also like to dance with the Hooligans club. If you're ever looking to play volleyball or interested in dancing, I'm your guy!

Hi, I'm a fourth year CS (BS) and Econ major with a Engineering Business minor. This is my 3rd semester TAing for 2150 and before that I was a TA for 1110. I got interested in programming to automate simple tasks such as alerting me when people get on the 2150 queue or getting basketball tickets to UVA games.<p>Outside of school I like to stay active (running, tennis, basketball, pretty much anything). Sadly, I also waste a lot of time playing video games (mostly PUBG and CSGO).

Hi! I’m Pragun, a third year majoring in Computer Science and Statistics in the college. I’m really excited to TA for CS 2150 this semester (for my first time), because it’s been one of my favorite classes and, more importantly, because I know firsthand that this class can be overwhelming at times. I love meeting new people so definitely don’t hesitate to reach out if you want someone to talk to about navigating this class or about something totally random. In my free time, I enjoy dancing salsa/bachata in the University Salsa Club (albeit a little hard to do that this semester) and adding to my many Spotify playlists. Excited to meet you guys and I’m looking forward to a fun semester!

I now strive to help other students learn, and get as much as possible from this course.<p>I love traveling, and experiencing other cultures, and I hope to travel to each continent some day. I was born in Seattle and I will always love the west coast. Social Psychology is my favorite course I've taken outside of the engineering school, and I find the studies of human behavior, philosophy, ethics, and history fascinating.<p>Hit me up if you ever have any questions about cyber security!
